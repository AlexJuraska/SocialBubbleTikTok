# Social Bubble TikTok

This repository contains the source code developed as part of my bachelor's thesis.

The code is separated into 3 parts

1. Data gathering and processing into JSON
2. Community generation
3. Visualization and transferring data into CSV for Cytoscape

Each section has its own README.md file which explains how to work with the code

The repository can be cloned from Github:
